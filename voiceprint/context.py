"""Reading the situation.

Before deciding how much of someone's voice to apply, the tool needs to know
what is being written. A note to a colleague and a board paper ask for
different things from the same person, and the honest answer is usually that
the person stays the same while the conventions move.

Context arrives one of three ways: a profile measured from real examples of
the target genre, a named register the caller already knows, or nothing at
all, in which case the writer's own voice stands unadjusted.
