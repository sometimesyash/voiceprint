"""Getting writing out of someone who has no archive.

The measurement problem has a supply-side answer as well as a statistical one.
Most people do have enough writing, it is simply scattered or unreachable, and
the rest can produce a few hundred words on demand if asked the right way.

These prompts are designed to pull unselfconscious prose. Two rules behind
them: never ask someone to describe how they write, because the description
will be aspirational and the writing will be stilted; and ask about something
they already have opinions about, because argument produces natural rhythm
where description produces lists.

Each prompt targets a register, so the answers can be tagged and kept apart
rather than pooled into an average of genres.
